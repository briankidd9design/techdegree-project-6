# Using the Express framework along with Node.JS I created a personal programming portfolio
#Exceeds:
I changed the package.json file so that the app will run with npm start

I created an error template that will display an error message with the error code and the error stack

CSS: I changed the font styles and colors. I changed the background colors of all sections 

extra: The portfolio is also able to be hosted on heroku.com as I added the Node version to the package.json file. I also created a Procfile with the proper seetup code (web: node app.js) so the site can be hosted on heroku.com
I also added the correct port path in the app.js file so that the app can be hosted both locally and on heroku.com
